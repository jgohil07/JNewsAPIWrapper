## Getting Started

Clone the GitHub repository and import the project in IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. Setup the build path and include necessary HTTP Client and JACKSON libraries.

** [News API](https://newsapi.org/) is a simple and easy-to-use API that returns JSON meta-data for the headlines currently published on a range of news sources and blogs**

JNewsAPIWrapper is essentially a API Wrapper written in Java. It is can fetch all Articles for all Sources for all available Categories provided by the News API. Use it for your own code or website. Get a jump start or integrate into existing code. News API requires a API key. Currently project has one free API key I have generated. It may not work if many users are requesting simultaneously.

**Be aware that different operations within project will need multiple parameters, failing to currently fulfil them will result in code throwing an Exception.**

## Future RoadMap

I started it to generate a single web page for personal use. Now, I am also looking at JavaFX and Windows UWP. Let me know if any ideas.
